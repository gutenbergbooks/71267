<span class="smallfont">—A SMALL—</span><br>
<span class="smcap xlargefont">Mail Order Business</span>.</h2>
</div>


<p>There are, in the United States and Canada,
hundreds of concerns who obtain their revenue
almost exclusively by means of transacting business
through the mails. In addition to these,
many regular city retailers have of late opened
departments for mail order trade.</p>

<p>The habit of purchasing by mail is rapidly assuming
enormous proportions in this country,
and the custom has been catered to, in such a
manner, that the ranchman on the plains may
wear a latest style metropolitan custom-made
suit, while his daughters may equip herself <i lang="fr">a la</i>
Fifth Avenue—all by inspection of a catalogue, a
postal money order and a letter.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Good Postal System.</h2>
</div>


<p>These facilities have been brought about by the
general march of improvement, and, perhaps,
more particularly on account of the greatly improved
postal system. Almost every intelligent<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
person has had more or less experience in buying
through the mails, but the object of this little
book is to show how a small business can be profitably
conducted for this purpose.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Start Right.</h2>
</div>


<p>One of the most essential things to start with is
an attractive article or line of goods. Shall it be
in the nature of a staple or a novelty? The difficulty
in handling staple goods in a small way is
the lack of profit.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Staple Goods.</h2>
</div>


<p>Staple goods are handled by retailers everywhere,
and, people will not readily send away for
that which they can procure at home. Of course,
there is always more or less mail trade on
specialties in the line of staples, such as Plymouth
Rock Pants, Douglas’ Shoes, etc., but even
then, manufacturers tell me that there is no profit
in the mail orders, they are handled merely for
the sake of augmenting regular trade by making
the goods popular.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might make an exception in the
staple list of watches, silverware and jewelry.
These are good mail order sellers.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Numerous Novelties.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the line of novelties, there are hundreds of
things such as books, toys, games, photographs,
perfumery, etc.</p>

<p>Small toys, not easily broken, and of light
weight when packed, sell in immense quantities
if advertised in November and December. Of
course, the advertisement must be properly arranged,
good journals used, and the price of the
toy should be small.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">“Frozen Perfumery.”</h2>
</div>


<p>Millions of perfumed cakes of Plaster-Paris, put
in small ornamented tin boxes, have been sold
during the past ten years. These goods cost
about 4 cents each, can be sold at ten cents, give
satisfaction if well made and can be mailed at a
cost of a cent each for postage, which will admit
of the “wonder stone” being wrapped in a
quantity of advertising circulars.</p>

<p>One or two ingenious advertisers put up packages
of sachet powder and sell them as “Love
Powders.” They are said to enable the recipient
to “gain and maintain the love of another.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Several Saleable Specialties.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheap books usually sell well if they <a id="Ref_4" href="#BRef_4">are</a> attractively<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
written up and advertised in the right
kind of papers. Millions of copies of certain
books have been sold at ten cents through the
mails. Of the <span class="smcap">Multum in Parvo Library</span>, of
which this little treatise is one, several millions
have been sold at ten cents per set of twelve titles.</p>

<p>People readily buy Japanese napkins, sometimes
advertised as handkerchiefs, (which they
really are), but the great sale may be due somewhat
to the fact that our country cousins do not
really know what a Japanese <i lang="fr">crepe</i> handkerchief
is and fondly imagine that they are to get a fifteen
inch pure silk affair. These goods can be procured
of Japanese importers in New York,
Chicago, San Francisco and other cities.</p>

<p>Cheap jewelry, such as rings, chains and the
like, generally sell well. The prices should be
low and the description must be strong, to attract
trade, however.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Watches by Mail.</h2>
</div>


<p>The watch mail order business is very large.
As a rule, Swiss watches are the sort dealt in.
The values of American watches are quite well
known, and they are on sale everywhere; but the
Swiss watches can be described in cash attracting
adjectives and when sold the margin of profit is
fairly good.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Indecent Advertising.</h2>
</div>


<p>Avoid the temptation to sell obscene goods, or
to sell any sort of stuff by so-called suggestive
announcements. This kind of business is profitable
while it lasts, but it usually ends in bringing
the advertiser into disrepute and imprisonment.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Don’t Lie.</h2>
</div>


<p>In writing a description of your goods, do not
misrepresent them. A dash of adjectives now
and then is customary and acceptable, for mild
exaggeration is expected. Nevertheless you must
not say that a ring has a diamond setting if it is
only glass.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Send Circulars.</h2>
</div>


<p>Have a catalogue or set of circulars advertising
various specialties, and send this printed matter
out with every package. If your first filling of an
order gives satisfaction, you are quite sure to get
a second order, and possibly several subsequent
orders.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Letters are Valuable.</h2>
</div>


<p>The letters that you receive from country customers
are more or less valuable. Other dealers
will purchase them of you for purpose of using
the addresses in sending out their own catalogues.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Good Sellers.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheap books with attractive titles are usually
fast selling property, and if contents are as advertised,
always give satisfaction. The Keystone
Book and News Co., 1111 Arch St., Philadelphia,
are among the leading wholesalers. They send
trade circulars only to persons who prove themselves
to be regularly engaged in the mail order
business.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Medical Business.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is surprising to note what a vast amount of
medicine is sent through the mails. There are
remedies for all diseases to which the flesh is heir.
If you have a good tonic, blood purifier, skin beautifier
or other preparation which you wish to push
the sale of, the better way to get “points” is to
answer the advertisements of other concerns advertising
similar specialties and learn their
methods. But do not copy other concerns’ literature;
simply pick out a few good ideas and combine
them with your own originality.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Advertising Agencies.</h2>
</div>


<p>A large proportion of advertising is placed
through so-called agents. They are a legion.
About a dozen make a specialty of mail order advertising.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
You can get further information by
reading a copy of <cite>Our Silent Partner</cite>, which you
can obtain free by writing to Fred Terry, Waterville,
Maine. There are a large number of publications
that pay for mail order advertising, and
a much larger number which do not pay the advertiser.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Not Tolerated.</h2>
</div>


<p>The U. S. and Canadian postal officials do not
encourage so-called “work at home” schemes
which usually take money out of poor people’s
pockets. Many alleged offenders have been prosecuted
for doing this sort of business.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Watch Your Mailing.</h2>
</div>


<p>If you are doing a large mailing don’t neglect
to make it a part of your duties to step in and
watch the operations of your mailing clerks
frequently. An employe sometimes forgets postal
rates and wastes a great deal of money. We
know an advertiser whose clerk sent out six thousand
packages with four cents postage on each
when the packages, consisting of printing matter,
could have traveled at two cents. Most of the
successful mail order advertisers keep their eyes
<a id="Ref_8" href="#BRef_8">on</a> such details and they save money thereby.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Not Good Criterion.</h2>
</div>


<p>The so-called “cost and result” schedules are
usually only valuable to the advertiser who prepares
them as a result of his own experience. To
all others who consider them, they are a delusion
and a snare. Suppose an advertisement of an
inch is placed in a list of publications by a watch
dealer, a picture dealer, a medical advertiser, a
novelty man and an agents’ supply house. There
will be quite a striking difference in the ratio of
results in each instance. A paper that pays one
may not pay the other. We have seen this
demonstrated so many times that we know
whereof we speak.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Advertising Axioms.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Virtue increases under a weight or burden”
and results increase with a comprehensive expenditure
of money in good advertising mediums.</p>

<p>“Better late than never.” The golden opportunity
is still open to him who would enrich himself
by judicious advertising. None other way
will pay.</p>

<p>“Mind moves matter.” Therefore exercise your
mind to advertise so as to stir the gray matter of
the brains of the people and affect their pocket-books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>Good goods will sell to good people constantly.
Poor goods only once. Don’t let people say,
“after having praised their wine they sell us
vinegar.”</p>

<p>“There is no lock but a golden key will open it,”
except that of the people’s pocket-book. First
class ads will do this with golden results. When
people think they want a thing, they do want it
and they get it.</p>

<p>To be prominent anywhere one must have
marked characteristics. So it is with an advertisement
in the crowded columns of newspapers
and magazines; in order to produce the best results
it must be clear, definite, conspicuous and
fresh. <em>Is yours of this character?</em></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Free.</h2>
</div>


<p>There’s the catch word of all humanity. Fifty
years ago it was the most potent word in the
language, and all the advertising experts who
have developed since have not succeeded in devising
one to succeed it.</p>

<p>Look over the papers which are read by the
simple country folk, and note how that word
stands out all over them. The article advertised
goes in agate type below it. The particulars
about what stamps or coins must be sent to secure
the “free” article, go in minion. The ad. may<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
occupy but an inch, and half of the inch may
consist of the one word “Free,” but the advertising
evidently pays if continuance signifies profit.</p>

<p>One sometimes wonders where the crop of gold
brick victims constantly comes from, where the
green goods men continually find patrons, and
why confidence men grow more numerous as
their wiles become better advertised. There is a
greater crop of “Free” victims growing somewhere.
It is hard to believe that anyone answers
a “Free” ad. twice, but this class of advertising
grows and prospers. This is a large country, and
the boys who are growing up must all learn by
experience what their fathers learned likewise.
No youth seems content to be taught in any other
way. It looks as if there was no danger of any
lack of advertising to teach them.—<cite>Exchange.</cite></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Old Story.</h2>
</div>


<p>A man generally knows his own business well
enough to make money out of it. When he attempts
another business he finds that some other
fellow has learned that business better than he
has, evidently. Few men ever learn enough about
more than one business to make both or all of
them pay.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Profitable Catalogues.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. John Lynn, of 48 Bond St., New York is a
successful dealer in novelties; his catalogue is
very attractive.</p>

<p>Another successful dealer is Chas. E. Marshall,
Lockport, N. Y. His catalogue is a winner.</p>

<p>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Chicago, do the
largest mail order business in the world. Their
catalogue is quite a large volume in itself.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Gets One on Depew.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is one of the stories about Chauncey M.
Depew and a railroad pass that is being told nowadays
in local railroad circles.</p>

<p>The president of the Waupaca and Nishna Railroad
company went to see the mild-mannered
president of the Vanderbilt system.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” Mr. Depew asked, letting
the smile he uses on such occasions have full
swing at the visitor.</p>

<p>“I dropped in to see you, Mr. Depew, to ask for
an exchange of courtesies. I am the president of
the Waupaca and Nishna Railroad company. I
would like to have a pass over your road and will
extend the same courtesy to yourself over my
road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>Depew looked thoughtful for a minute. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“Where is your road?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s out in Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>“Is it rated in Poor’s manual?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed; we paid a nice dividend last
year.”</p>

<p>“Strange. I never heard of your road. How
long is it?”</p>

<p>“We are operating sixty-seven miles this year.”</p>

<p>“What, sixty-seven miles, and you call that an
exchange of courtesy, and the Vanderbilt system
has its thousands of miles?”</p>

<p>Depew assumed his most cavalier air as he
launched that question at the head of the president
of the Waupaca and Nishna and then he
waited for a reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Depew,” said the western railroad
president as he arose to go, “your road may be a
little longer than mine, but it ain’t any wider.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">His Joke Worked Badly.</h2>
</div>


<p>A young man who seemed to be boiling over to
do something smart was a passenger on a Michigan
avenue car the other day. After racking his massive
brain for a while he took out a silver dollar
and laid it on the seat and took a seat opposite.
The car soon stopped at a crossing to let on an old<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
woman with a basket. She saw the empty seat
and the dollar, and it didn’t take her over thirty
seconds to drop herself into the place and the dollar
into her pocket.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, ma’am,” said the joker, “but I’ve
lost a dollar. I think I left it on that seat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” she bluntly replied.</p>

<p>“But I’m sure of it. Did you pick up a dollar?”</p>

<p>“None of your business, sir.”</p>

<p>“But all of us saw you pick it up, ma’am, and I
can prove it was mine.”</p>

<p>“Look a’ here, young chap,” she said, as she
put down her basket, “if it’s a row you want you’ll
find me ready. I allow no one to walk on me.”</p>

<p>“But, ma’am, I left——”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” she said, as she stood up and
doubled up her fists. “I am a peaceful woman,
and I want to get along the easiest way, but if I
must I will.”</p>

<p>Everybody began to clap and laugh, and the
smart Aleck took a drop off the platform without
asking what it was all about.</p>

equines. One day Mr. Jones told Mike to hitch up
his horse and bring it around to his residence.</p>

<p>Mike did as he was bidden, but when Mr. Jones
saw the turnout he said: “Why, Mike, that is not
my horse, that is Mr. Smith’s animal.”</p>

<p>“Begorra,” promptly replied Mike, “so it is. I
knowed that wasn’t your horse, sir, but I couldn’t
quite make up my mind which horse belonged to
the other gintleman.”</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
