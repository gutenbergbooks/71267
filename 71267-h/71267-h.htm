<span class="smallfont">—A SMALL—</span><br>
<span class="smcap xlargefont">Mail Order Business</span>.</h2>
</div>


<p>There are, in the United States and Canada,
hundreds of concerns who obtain their revenue
almost exclusively by means of transacting business
through the mails. In addition to these,
many regular city retailers have of late opened
departments for mail order trade.</p>

<p>The habit of purchasing by mail is rapidly assuming
enormous proportions in this country,
and the custom has been catered to, in such a
manner, that the ranchman on the plains may
wear a latest style metropolitan custom-made
suit, while his daughters may equip herself <i lang="fr">a la</i>
Fifth Avenue—all by inspection of a catalogue, a
postal money order and a letter.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Good Postal System.</h2>
</div>


<p>These facilities have been brought about by the
general march of improvement, and, perhaps,
more particularly on account of the greatly improved
postal system. Almost every intelligent<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
person has had more or less experience in buying
through the mails, but the object of this little
book is to show how a small business can be profitably
conducted for this purpose.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Start Right.</h2>
</div>


<p>One of the most essential things to start with is
an attractive article or line of goods. Shall it be
in the nature of a staple or a novelty? The difficulty
in handling staple goods in a small way is
the lack of profit.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Staple Goods.</h2>
</div>


<p>Staple goods are handled by retailers everywhere,
and, people will not readily send away for
that which they can procure at home. Of course,
there is always more or less mail trade on
specialties in the line of staples, such as Plymouth
Rock Pants, Douglas’ Shoes, etc., but even
then, manufacturers tell me that there is no profit
in the mail orders, they are handled merely for
the sake of augmenting regular trade by making
the goods popular.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might make an exception in the
staple list of watches, silverware and jewelry.
These are good mail order sellers.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Numerous Novelties.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the line of novelties, there are hundreds of
things such as books, toys, games, photographs,
perfumery, etc.</p>

<p>Small toys, not easily broken, and of light
weight when packed, sell in immense quantities
if advertised in November and December. Of
course, the advertisement must be properly arranged,
good journals used, and the price of the
toy should be small.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">“Frozen Perfumery.”</h2>
</div>


<p>Millions of perfumed cakes of Plaster-Paris, put
in small ornamented tin boxes, have been sold
during the past ten years. These goods cost
about 4 cents each, can be sold at ten cents, give
satisfaction if well made and can be mailed at a
cost of a cent each for postage, which will admit
of the “wonder stone” being wrapped in a
quantity of advertising circulars.</p>

<p>One or two ingenious advertisers put up packages
of sachet powder and sell them as “Love
Powders.” They are said to enable the recipient
to “gain and maintain the love of another.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Several Saleable Specialties.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheap books usually sell well if they <a id="Ref_4" href="#BRef_4">are</a> attractively<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
written up and advertised in the right
kind of papers. Millions of copies of certain
books have been sold at ten cents through the
mails. Of the <span class="smcap">Multum in Parvo Library</span>, of
which this little treatise is one, several millions
have been sold at ten cents per set of twelve titles.</p>

<p>People readily buy Japanese napkins, sometimes
advertised as handkerchiefs, (which they
really are), but the great sale may be due somewhat
to the fact that our country cousins do not
really know what a Japanese <i lang="fr">crepe</i> handkerchief
is and fondly imagine that they are to get a fifteen
inch pure silk affair. These goods can be procured
of Japanese importers in New York,
Chicago, San Francisco and other cities.</p>

<p>Cheap jewelry, such as rings, chains and the
like, generally sell well. The prices should be
low and the description must be strong, to attract
trade, however.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Watches by Mail.</h2>
</div>


<p>The watch mail order business is very large.
As a rule, Swiss watches are the sort dealt in.
The values of American watches are quite well
known, and they are on sale everywhere; but the
Swiss watches can be described in cash attracting
adjectives and when sold the margin of profit is
fairly good.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Indecent Advertising.</h2>
</div>


<p>Avoid the temptation to sell obscene goods, or
to sell any sort of stuff by so-called suggestive
announcements. This kind of business is profitable
while it lasts, but it usually ends in bringing
the advertiser into disrepute and imprisonment.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Don’t Lie.</h2>
</div>


<p>In writing a description of your goods, do not
misrepresent them. A dash of adjectives now
and then is customary and acceptable, for mild
exaggeration is expected. Nevertheless you must
not say that a ring has a diamond setting if it is
only glass.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Send Circulars.</h2>
</div>


<p>Have a catalogue or set of circulars advertising
various specialties, and send this printed matter
out with every package. If your first filling of an
order gives satisfaction, you are quite sure to get
a second order, and possibly several subsequent
orders.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Letters are Valuable.</h2>
</div>


<p>The letters that you receive from country customers
are more or less valuable. Other dealers
will purchase them of you for purpose of using
the addresses in sending out their own catalogues.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Good Sellers.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheap books with attractive titles are usually
fast selling property, and if contents are as advertised,
always give satisfaction. The Keystone
Book and News Co., 1111 Arch St., Philadelphia,
are among the leading wholesalers. They send
trade circulars only to persons who prove themselves
to be regularly engaged in the mail order
business.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Medical Business.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is surprising to note what a vast amount of
medicine is sent through the mails. There are
remedies for all diseases to which the flesh is heir.
If you have a good tonic, blood purifier, skin beautifier
or other preparation which you wish to push
the sale of, the better way to get “points” is to
answer the advertisements of other concerns advertising
similar specialties and learn their
methods. But do not copy other concerns’ literature;
simply pick out a few good ideas and combine
them with your own originality.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Advertising Agencies.</h2>
</div>


<p>A large proportion of advertising is placed
through so-called agents. They are a legion.
About a dozen make a specialty of mail order advertising.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
You can get further information by
reading a copy of <cite>Our Silent Partner</cite>, which you
can obtain free by writing to Fred Terry, Waterville,
Maine. There are a large number of publications
that pay for mail order advertising, and
a much larger number which do not pay the advertiser.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Not Tolerated.</h2>
</div>


<p>The U. S. and Canadian postal officials do not
encourage so-called “work at home” schemes
which usually take money out of poor people’s
pockets. Many alleged offenders have been prosecuted
for doing this sort of business.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Watch Your Mailing.</h2>
</div>


<p>If you are doing a large mailing don’t neglect
to make it a part of your duties to step in and
watch the operations of your mailing clerks
frequently. An employe sometimes forgets postal
rates and wastes a great deal of money. We
know an advertiser whose clerk sent out six thousand
packages with four cents postage on each
when the packages, consisting of printing matter,
could have traveled at two cents. Most of the
successful mail order advertisers keep their eyes
<a id="Ref_8" href="#BRef_8">on</a> such details and they save money thereby.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Not Good Criterion.</h2>
</div>


<p>The so-called “cost and result” schedules are
usually only valuable to the advertiser who prepares
them as a result of his own experience. To
all others who consider them, they are a delusion
and a snare. Suppose an advertisement of an
inch is placed in a list of publications by a watch
dealer, a picture dealer, a medical advertiser, a
novelty man and an agents’ supply house. There
will be quite a striking difference in the ratio of
results in each instance. A paper that pays one
may not pay the other. We have seen this
demonstrated so many times that we know
whereof we speak.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Advertising Axioms.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Virtue increases under a weight or burden”
and results increase with a comprehensive expenditure
of money in good advertising mediums.</p>

<p>“Better late than never.” The golden opportunity
is still open to him who would enrich himself
by judicious advertising. None other way
will pay.</p>

<p>“Mind moves matter.” Therefore exercise your
mind to advertise so as to stir the gray matter of
the brains of the people and affect their pocket-books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>Good goods will sell to good people constantly.
Poor goods only once. Don’t let people say,
“after having praised their wine they sell us
vinegar.”</p>

<p>“There is no lock but a golden key will open it,”
except that of the people’s pocket-book. First
class ads will do this with golden results. When
people think they want a thing, they do want it
and they get it.</p>

<p>To be prominent anywhere one must have
marked characteristics. So it is with an advertisement
in the crowded columns of newspapers
and magazines; in order to produce the best results
it must be clear, definite, conspicuous and
fresh. <em>Is yours of this character?</em></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Free.</h2>
</div>


<p>There’s the catch word of all humanity. Fifty
years ago it was the most potent word in the
language, and all the advertising experts who
have developed since have not succeeded in devising
one to succeed it.</p>

<p>Look over the papers which are read by the
simple country folk, and note how that word
stands out all over them. The article advertised
goes in agate type below it. The particulars
about what stamps or coins must be sent to secure
the “free” article, go in minion. The ad. may<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
occupy but an inch, and half of the inch may
consist of the one word “Free,” but the advertising
evidently pays if continuance signifies profit.</p>

<p>One sometimes wonders where the crop of gold
brick victims constantly comes from, where the
green goods men continually find patrons, and
why confidence men grow more numerous as
their wiles become better advertised. There is a
greater crop of “Free” victims growing somewhere.
It is hard to believe that anyone answers
a “Free” ad. twice, but this class of advertising
grows and prospers. This is a large country, and
the boys who are growing up must all learn by
experience what their fathers learned likewise.
No youth seems content to be taught in any other
way. It looks as if there was no danger of any
lack of advertising to teach them.—<cite>Exchange.</cite></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Old Story.</h2>
</div>


<p>A man generally knows his own business well
enough to make money out of it. When he attempts
another business he finds that some other
fellow has learned that business better than he
has, evidently. Few men ever learn enough about
more than one business to make both or all of
them pay.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Profitable Catalogues.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. John Lynn, of 48 Bond St., New York is a
successful dealer in novelties; his catalogue is
very attractive.</p>

<p>Another successful dealer is Chas. E. Marshall,
Lockport, N. Y. His catalogue is a winner.</p>

<p>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Chicago, do the
largest mail order business in the world. Their
catalogue is quite a large volume in itself.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Gets One on Depew.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is one of the stories about Chauncey M.
Depew and a railroad pass that is being told nowadays
in local railroad circles.</p>

<p>The president of the Waupaca and Nishna Railroad
company went to see the mild-mannered
president of the Vanderbilt system.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” Mr. Depew asked, letting
the smile he uses on such occasions have full
swing at the visitor.</p>

<p>“I dropped in to see you, Mr. Depew, to ask for
an exchange of courtesies. I am the president of
the Waupaca and Nishna Railroad company. I
would like to have a pass over your road and will
extend the same courtesy to yourself over my
road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>Depew looked thoughtful for a minute. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“Where is your road?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s out in Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>“Is it rated in Poor’s manual?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed; we paid a nice dividend last
year.”</p>

<p>“Strange. I never heard of your road. How
long is it?”</p>

<p>“We are operating sixty-seven miles this year.”</p>

<p>“What, sixty-seven miles, and you call that an
exchange of courtesy, and the Vanderbilt system
has its thousands of miles?”</p>

<p>Depew assumed his most cavalier air as he
launched that question at the head of the president
of the Waupaca and Nishna and then he
waited for a reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Depew,” said the western railroad
president as he arose to go, “your road may be a
little longer than mine, but it ain’t any wider.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">His Joke Worked Badly.</h2>
</div>


<p>A young man who seemed to be boiling over to
do something smart was a passenger on a Michigan
avenue car the other day. After racking his massive
brain for a while he took out a silver dollar
and laid it on the seat and took a seat opposite.
The car soon stopped at a crossing to let on an old<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
woman with a basket. She saw the empty seat
and the dollar, and it didn’t take her over thirty
seconds to drop herself into the place and the dollar
into her pocket.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, ma’am,” said the joker, “but I’ve
lost a dollar. I think I left it on that seat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” she bluntly replied.</p>

<p>“But I’m sure of it. Did you pick up a dollar?”</p>

<p>“None of your business, sir.”</p>

<p>“But all of us saw you pick it up, ma’am, and I
can prove it was mine.”</p>

<p>“Look a’ here, young chap,” she said, as she
put down her basket, “if it’s a row you want you’ll
find me ready. I allow no one to walk on me.”</p>

<p>“But, ma’am, I left——”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” she said, as she stood up and
doubled up her fists. “I am a peaceful woman,
and I want to get along the easiest way, but if I
must I will.”</p>

<p>Everybody began to clap and laugh, and the
smart Aleck took a drop off the platform without
asking what it was all about.</p>

his horse and bring it around to his residence.</p>

<p>Mike did as he was bidden, but when Mr. Jones

my horse, that is Mr. Smith’s animal.”</p>

<p>“Begorra,” promptly replied Mike, “so it is. I
